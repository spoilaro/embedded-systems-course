We pretty much copied the whole setup code as well as ADC conversion from the exercise tips. 

In the while loop, first, we declare the buffer variable for storing char data.
Then, with itoa, we convert the digital value to a char value, store it into the buffer, clear the lcd screen, set the new value to the lcd screen, and the adc conversion completion variable to false.
